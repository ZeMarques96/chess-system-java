# Chess system based solely on Java and Object-Oriented Programming

Chess Game Project featuring the unique movements of each chess piece, in addition to special moves such as Castling and En Passant, along with pawn promotion. The project itself does not utilize any frameworks, relying solely on the Java programming language and Object-Oriented Programming principles.

The project was developed as part of a Java course led by Professor NÃ©lio Alves. Inside the "chess-design" folder lies the UML diagram that served as the foundation for its implementation.
